# MKRWAN1300 FIRMWARE

This package contains the firmware for Murata CMWX1ZZABZ-078 module.

It is derived from [I-CUBE-LRWAN](http://www.st.com/en/embedded-software/i-cube-lrwan.html), with some new APIs (like the ability to switch band at runtime, not only at compile time).

The project is provided a [System Workbench for STM32](http://www.openstm32.org/System%2BWorkbench%2Bfor%2BSTM32) project, but can also be compiled in Eclipse after following [this](http://www.openstm32.org/Installing%2BSystem%2BWorkbench%2Bfor%2BSTM32%2Bfrom%2BEclipse#Important_note_about_your_MAC_OSX_host_version) guide

[Releases](https://github.com/bcmi-labs/mkrwan1300-fw/releases) contains the precompiled firmware that can be uploaded either using FWUpdaterBridge or MKRWANFWUpdate_standalone examples from in https://github.com/arduino-libraries/MKRWAN

All the code maintains its original license.
